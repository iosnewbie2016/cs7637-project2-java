### Solving Raven's Progressive Matrices Test Using Fractal Processing ###

This Java application attempts to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test by implementing the fractal processing method proposed by Dr. Keith McGreggor of the Georgia Institute of Technology. To learn more about the RPM test and the scope of this application read the 'project-description.pdf' file located in this repository.

To learn more about fractal processing read the following papers by Dr. McGreggor:
